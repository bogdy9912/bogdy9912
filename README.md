## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ On my profile, youâ€™ll find three main types of projects:

- **Mobile**:
  - A bunch of **Flutter** projects, some were just for fun, and others started as potential startup ideas (but ended up being fun projects too).
  - A few **React Native** projects (I briefly strayed from Flutter to try out the competition).

- **Web**:
  - Mostly **React**, around 10 projects, all made for fun and experimentation.

- **Blockchain**:
  - Plenty of **Solidity** work, especially focusing on security. Youâ€™ll see a lot of forks here.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on products that genuinely improve peopleâ€™s lives!
